### Source code and Installation
The API provides a reference implementation which will be the base to all future implementations. On JSR 354, Money-Api, the reference implementation is **Moneta**. For more information about the project see [https://github.com/JavaMoney/jsr354-ri](https://github.com/JavaMoney/jsr354-ri) . 

####Installing the Project
You could either add it to your project as a dependency from the maven repository or install it from source. The maven repo could be found here:
[http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.javamoney/moneta](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.javamoney/moneta)

#####Adding the dependencies 
Maven
```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.javamoney</groupId>
            <artifactId>moneta</artifactId>
            <version>moneta_version</version>
        </dependency>
```

Gradle
```
'org.javamoney:moneta:moneta_version'
```

Ivy

```
<dependency org="org.javamoney" name="moneta" rev="moneta_version"/>
```

Now you are ready to go and use the API in your project.

#####Installing from Source
Another option is to install the project from source. This requires having Git and maven installed as well as Java 8. 


Clone the source of  javamoney-parent using the following command

```
git clone https://github.com/JavaMoney/javamoney-parent.git
```

Switch to the containing folder

```
cd javamoney-parent
```
Compile the source and install it, the tests will be skipped in this case

```
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip
```

Done! The next step will be to install Moneta from source.

Clone Moneta's source to your local machine 

```
git clone git@github.com:JavaMoney/jsr354-ri.git
```

Switch to the containing folder
```
cd jsr354-ri
```

Compile the source and install it, the tests will be skipped in this case

```
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip
```
Done, the code was compiled and installed on your local machine. In this book we will be using the master from Github repository, so we recommend  installing locally.
