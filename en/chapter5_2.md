### Exchange rate from a specific data

For some reasons in the application is important to know not just the exchange rate most recent, but an exchange rate from a distinct date, from example, when rent a room in the hotel, normally will be used the rate when the room was reserved or in the credit card that use the rate when the bill was closed. **Moneta** gives support to do it, just use the `ConversationQuery` class, it is possible find out with defined date or a range of dates. The representation that is accepted for date is the `LocalDate` class.


```java
public class ExchangeRateProviderExample2 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        CurrencyUnit dollar = Monetary.getCurrency("USD");
        CurrencyUnit real = Monetary.getCurrency("BRL");

        MonetaryAmount money = FastMoney.of(10, dollar);
        MonetaryAmount money2 = FastMoney.of(10, real);


        LocalDate localDate = Year.of(2009).atMonth(Month.JANUARY).atDay(9);

        ExchangeRateProvider provider = MonetaryConversions.getExchangeRateProvider(ExchangeRateType.IMF_HIST);
        ConversionQuery query = ConversionQueryBuilder.of().setTermCurrency(dollar).set(localDate).build();

        CurrencyConversion currencyConversion = provider.getCurrencyConversion(query);

        MonetaryAmount result = currencyConversion.apply(money2);
        MonetaryAmount monetaryAmount = money.add(result);
        System.out.println(monetaryAmount);
    }
}
```

If **Moneta** doesn't find the date, will return an exception, for example, will not possible find a rate from January 9th of 2011, once this date was on Sunday and almost always providers of this information doesn't work on this day.


```java
public class ExchangeRateProviderExample3 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        CurrencyUnit dollar = Monetary.getCurrency("USD");
        CurrencyUnit real = Monetary.getCurrency("BRL");

        MonetaryAmount money = FastMoney.of(10, dollar);
        MonetaryAmount money2 = FastMoney.of(10, real);


        LocalDate localDate = Year.of(2011).atMonth(Month.JANUARY).atDay(9);

        ExchangeRateProvider provider = MonetaryConversions.getExchangeRateProvider(ExchangeRateType.IMF_HIST);
        ConversionQuery query = ConversionQueryBuilder.of().setTermCurrency(dollar).set(localDate).build();

        CurrencyConversion currencyConversion = provider.getCurrencyConversion(query);

        MonetaryAmount result = currencyConversion.apply(money2);//javax.money.MonetaryException: There is not exchange on day 2011-01-09 to rate to  rate on IFMRateProvider.


    }
}
```


A possible solution to this problem is inform a range of dates, this way, the implementation will find out for all dates, if it doesn't find all will return an exception, worth pointing out, the implementation will find out by the same order that was informed.

```java
public class ExchangeRateProviderExample4 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        CurrencyUnit dollar = Monetary.getCurrency("USD");
        CurrencyUnit real = Monetary.getCurrency("BRL");

        MonetaryAmount money = FastMoney.of(10, dollar);
        MonetaryAmount money2 = FastMoney.of(10, real);


        LocalDate localDate = Year.of(2011).atMonth(Month.JANUARY).atDay(9);
        LocalDate[] localDates = Stream.of(localDate, localDate.minusDays(1L), localDate.minusDays(2L),
                localDate.minusDays(3L)).sorted(Comparator.<LocalDate>naturalOrder().reversed()).toArray(LocalDate[]::new);
        ExchangeRateProvider provider = MonetaryConversions.getExchangeRateProvider(ExchangeRateType.IMF_HIST);
        ConversionQuery query = ConversionQueryBuilder.of().setTermCurrency(dollar).set(localDates).build();

        CurrencyConversion currencyConversion = provider.getCurrencyConversion(query);

        MonetaryAmount result = currencyConversion.apply(money2);
        MonetaryAmount sum = money.add(result);

    }
}
```
