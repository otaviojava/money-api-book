## What has been done? Knowing the API

In the last chapter we discussed the advantages of introducing the money type. 
A lot of smart Java developers have tackled this problem previously and developed dedicated APIs to deal with money. There are lot of APIs out there including decent open source and proprietary projects but unfortunately the efforts weren't standardised in a specification. **JSR 354** is a specification to standardise all these appreciated and decent APIs.

Once we get a standard interface, communities, enterprises, and developers can pick an implementation and use it in their projects. The common interface will make the code more portable and maintainable. Think of how easy it is to change your underlying  SQL database if you are using JDBC, just change the driver and everything else will remain unchanged.
