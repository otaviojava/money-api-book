### Arithmetics operations:


The `MonetaryAmount` can does arithmetics operation such subtract and sum, just to remember, all implementation must be immutable, in other words, the result of the operation will be the return, another instance, once the `MonetaryAmount` implementations are unchanged and the implementation that will chosen will the instance that called the method. 

```java
public class ArithmeticOperations {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CurrencyUnit currency = Monetary.getCurrency("BRL");
        MonetaryAmount money = Money.of(BigDecimal.TEN, currency);
        MonetaryAmount money2 = FastMoney.of(BigDecimal.TEN, currency);
        MonetaryAmount addResult = money.add(money2);//BRL 20 Money implementation
        MonetaryAmount subtractResult = money2.subtract(addResult);//BRL -10 FastMoney implementation
    }
}
```

To do multiplication, division and remain operation is necessary to pass a `Number` instance parameter.

```java
public class ArithmeticOperations2 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CurrencyUnit currency = Monetary.getCurrency("BRL");
        MonetaryAmount money = Money.of(100, currency);
        Number number = 20;
        MonetaryAmount divideResult = money.divide(number);//BRL 5
        MonetaryAmount remainderResult = money.remainder(30);//BRL 10
        MonetaryAmount resultMultiply = money.multiply(5);//BRL 500
    }
}
```

Also is possible do operation just using signal on `MonetaryAmount`.



```java
public class ArithmeticOperations3 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CurrencyUnit currency = Monetary.getCurrency("BRL");
        MonetaryAmount money = Money.of(100, currency);
        MonetaryAmount negateResult = money.negate();//BRL -100
        MonetaryAmount plusResult = money.plus();//BRL 100
    }
}
```
