# Introduction

Many systems of information work with monetary values. However, funnily, concerns about money and currency calculations are just delegated to primitives types like `Float`, `Double` and `BigDecimal`. Some systems with a thorough design have their own implementation of money and currency. But when its a common problem why not have a common solution?

The JSR 354 (Money and Currency API) is a work towards defining an API for this and provides representation about the approach around money and currency.
